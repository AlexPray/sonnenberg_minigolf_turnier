# Projekt discontinued

### Introduction

We had the idea to make a miniature golf tournament for our employees at Hotel Sonnenberg. 
It was my job to make a small Website to display which teams & players are running the game.

This was good training for me to use a Headless CMS since the points should be entered by the tournament manager.
In this case, I used Contentful.

Since the tournament was canceled, I stopped working on this project. This project isn't finished,
but I learned the most important thing, which is how to set up a Contentful and how to fetch and work with the data from there.
I also had some figma training during this project.
